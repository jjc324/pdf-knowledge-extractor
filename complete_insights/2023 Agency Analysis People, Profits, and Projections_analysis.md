## Analysis

# 2023 Agency Analysis: Comprehensive Insights

## 1. Executive Summary

This report analyzes the performance of 30 agencies in 2023 from Hampton's private community, revealing a challenging year marked by post-pandemic adjustments. Despite generating an average revenue of $5.3M with 21% profit margins, agencies faced operational difficulties stemming from aggressive 2022 hiring and subsequent market slowdowns. The data provides critical benchmarks for agency performance across different revenue scales and service types.

## 2. Key Insights

- **Consulting dominance**: Consulting agencies generated nearly double the revenue of other service categories
- **Scale paradox**: Profit margins actually decreased as revenue grew from $1M to $10M, only recovering above $10M
- **Offshore leverage**: Agencies under $10M heavily rely on offshore teams to maintain profitability
- **Revenue per employee benchmark**: $238K for FTEs, dropping to $150-264K when including contractors
- **Growth hangover**: Most agencies suffered from 2022 over-hiring that hurt 2023 profitability

## 3. Main Themes

### **Post-Growth Adjustment Period**
Agencies experienced a painful recalibration after rapid 2022 expansion, with many struggling to right-size their operations.

### **Geographic Arbitrage Strategy**
83% of agencies in North America leverage offshore talent, with some agencies having 80%+ of their workforce overseas.

### **Service Model Impact on Scalability**
Consulting services show superior revenue generation compared to execution-heavy services like design/development.

### **The $10M Inflection Point**
A clear performance threshold exists at $10M revenue where margins improve and contractor ratios significantly increase.
