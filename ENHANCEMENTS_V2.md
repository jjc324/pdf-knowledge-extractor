# PDF Knowledge Extractor v2.0 - Smart Batch Optimization

## 🚀 New Features Overview

The PDF Knowledge Extractor has been significantly enhanced with intelligent batch optimization and content filtering to improve success rates and user experience. This document outlines all the new features and how to use them.

## 🧠 Core Enhancements

### 1. Dynamic Batch Sizing

Intelligent batch sizing based on document complexity automatically optimizes processing efficiency:

- **Small documents** (< 5k tokens): batches of 8-10
- **Medium documents** (5k-20k tokens): batches of 3-5  
- **Large documents** (20k+ tokens): batches of 1-2
- **Previously failed documents**: processed individually for easier debugging

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# Enable adaptive batching (default)
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --mode claude-batch --adaptive-batching

# Disable adaptive batching
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --mode claude-batch --no-adaptive-batching
```

### 2. Content-Aware Pre-filtering

Advanced document quality scoring system that analyzes:
- **Text Quality** (40% weight): Alphanumeric ratio and character distribution
- **Extraction Ratio** (25% weight): How much text was successfully extracted
- **Content Density** (15% weight): Word-to-character ratio analysis
- **Language Quality** (10% weight): Unique word ratio and repetition detection
- **Structure Quality** (10% weight): Presence of paragraphs, lists, and formatting

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# Set quality threshold (0.0-1.0, default: 0.5)
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --mode claude-batch --quality-threshold 0.7

# Preview quality distribution before processing
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --preview
```

### 3. Enhanced Progress Tracking & ETA

Real-time metrics and intelligent time estimation:
- **Success rate trends**: "improving", "declining", "stable"
- **Processing rate trends**: "accelerating", "slowing", "stable"
- **Smart ETA calculation**: Considers trends and health status
- **Token processing metrics**: Tokens/minute, time per token
- **Quality and type distributions**: Real-time breakdown

### 4. Smart Retry Logic with Quarantine System

Intelligent retry strategies based on document characteristics:

- **Aggressive**: For high-quality documents with temporary issues
- **Standard**: Normal retry behavior for most documents
- **Conservative**: Longer delays for problematic documents
- **Skip**: For documents with very low success probability

**Quarantine System:**
- Automatically quarantines repeatedly failing documents
- Exponential backoff for quarantined documents (max 24 hours)
- Smart release conditions based on time and success probability

### 5. Document Type Detection

Automatic classification of document types:
- **Academic**: Research papers, journals, dissertations
- **Business**: Reports, proposals, financial documents
- **Technical**: Manuals, specifications, engineering docs
- **Legal**: Contracts, agreements, regulations
- **Creative**: Essays, articles, literary works
- **General**: Unclassified documents

### 6. New CLI Features

**Preview Mode:**
```bash
# Get detailed job analysis before processing
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --preview
```

**Fast Mode:**
```bash
# Aggressive processing with lower quality thresholds
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --mode claude-batch --fast-mode
```

**Quarantine Management:**
```bash
# List quarantined documents
pdf-extract --quarantine-management list

# Release all quarantined documents
pdf-extract --quarantine-management release

# Clear all quarantine records
pdf-extract --quarantine-management clear
```

### 7. Performance Monitoring

Comprehensive metrics collection and reporting:
- **Quality performance analysis**: Success rates by quality level
- **Document type performance**: Success rates by document type
- **Retry pattern analysis**: Distribution of retry attempts
- **Error categorization**: Most common failure types
- **Processing recommendations**: Actionable optimization suggestions

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Backward Compatible)
```bash
# Standard analysis (unchanged)
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --mode analyze

# Standard Claude processing (with new enhancements)
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --mode claude-batch
```

### Advanced Usage with New Features

**1. Preview Before Processing:**
```bash
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --preview --recursive
```

**2. High-Quality Processing:**
```bash
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --mode claude-batch \
  --quality-threshold 0.8 \
  --adaptive-batching \
  --skip-failed
```

**3. Fast Processing for Large Volumes:**
```bash
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --mode claude-batch \
  --fast-mode \
  --batch-size 12 \
  --max-retries 2
```

**4. Conservative Processing for Difficult Documents:**
```bash
pdf-extract /path/to/pdfs --mode claude-batch \
  --quality-threshold 0.3 \
  --no-adaptive-batching \
  --max-retries 5 \
  --claude-timeout 300
```

## 📊 Generated Reports

The enhanced system generates several detailed reports:

### 1. Processing Summary (`processing_summary.md`)

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Quality Scoring Algorithm
The quality score is calculated using a weighted average:
- Text Quality: 40% (alphanumeric ratio, character distribution)
- Extraction Ratio: 25% (text length vs expected)
- Content Density: 15% (word-to-character ratio)
- Language Quality: 10% (unique word ratio)
- Structure Quality: 10% (formatting indicators)

### Adaptive Batching Algorithm
Documents are grouped by complexity and processed with optimal batch sizes:
1. Group documents by token count (small, medium, large)
2. Group failed documents separately
3. Calculate adaptive batch size per group
4. Apply token limits based on complexity
5. Log detailed batch statistics

### Smart Retry Strategy
The retry strategy is determined by:
- Document quality score
- Previous failure pattern
- Consecutive failure count
- Success probability calculation
- Error type categorization

This comprehensive enhancement maintains full backward compatibility while providing powerful new capabilities for optimizing PDF knowledge extraction workflows.
